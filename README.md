## Class 1 : Relation Model

**Relation Algebra**

- ùúé Select
- ùõ± Projection
- ‚à™ Union
- ‚à© Intersection
- ‚àí Difference
- √ó Product
- ‚ãà Join

**Extra Operators of Relation Algebra:**

- ùû∫ Rename
- R<-S Assignment
- ùù≥ Duplicate Elimination
- ùù™ Aggregation
- ùõï Sorting
- r√∑S Division

## Class 2: Advanced SQL

Relational algebra not only define the data we want, but also defined the order we do query.

But we dont exactly need to define an specifc order. User oly needs to dpecify the answer that they want, not how to compute it. That why we need advanced 

The DBMS is responsible for efficent evaluation of the query:

- Query optimizer: re-orders operations and generatews query plan

**History of SQL:**

- "SEQUEL" (Structured English Query Language) from IBM's **System R** prototype
- Oracle Adopted SEQUEL and IBM's DB2 in 1983 supports SEQUEL, so it become de facto standard
- "SQL" (Structured Query Language) become Standard in 1986(ANSI) and 1987(ISO)

### Relational Languages:

- Data Definition Language (DDL)

  - SELECT INSERT UPDATE DELETE MERGE CALL (EXPLAIN PLAN) (LOCK TABLE) Á≠â
- Data Control Language (DCL)
  - ÊùÉÈôêÊéßÂà∂
  - GRANT REVOKE

**Aggregates:**

Functions that return a singel value from a bag of tuples:

- AVG(col) : Return the average col value
- MIN(col) : Return the minimum col value
- MAX(col) : Return maximun col value
- SUM(col) : Return sum of value in col
- COUNT(col) : Return # of values for col

Eg. we can only select **GROUP BY ed** col if we used aggregating fuctions. We can filter aggregated col with **HAVING** but not WHERE.

``` SQL
SELECT AVE(s.gpa) as ave_gpa, e.cid
FROM enrolled AS e, student AS s
WHERE e.sid = s.sid
GROUP BY e.cid
HAVING avg_gpa > 3.9;
```

**String Operation:**

Only MySQL is Case **Insensitive**, Only MySQL/SQLite supports Double Quotes. All the other DB is Case Sensitive and using Single Only Quotes.

**Date/Time Operations:**

Date operation differs from different DB.

**Output Control:**

ORDER BY \<col\> [ASC|DESC]
LIMIT \<count\> [OFFSET \<count\>]

**Nested Queries:**

eg.

``` SQL
SELECT name FROM student WHERE sid IN (SELECT sid FROM enrolled);

# or

SELECT (SELECT S.name FROM student AS S WHERE S.sid = E.sid) AS sname
FROM enrolled AS E
WHERE cid = '15-445';
```

## Class 3: Database Storage

**Different Level of Database System:**

- Query Planning
- Operator Execution
- Access Methods
- Buffer Pool Manager
- Disk Manager

**Disk-Oriented Architectur:** assumes that the primary storage location of database is on non-volatile disk. DBMS's components manage the movement of data between non-volatile and volatile storage.

**Time Cost of:**

- L1 Cache Ref: 0.5ns
- L2 Cache Ref: 7ns
- DRAM: 100ns
- SSD: 150,000ns
- HDD: 10,000,000ns
- Network Storage: 30,000,000ns

Some DB use **mmap** to use virtual memory (like levelDB LMDB). Some Partially use (like mongoDB SQLite). Moth main stream DB do not use (like MySQL, Oracle).

But, DBMS wants to control things itself and can do a better job (than OS) at it, like:

- Flushing ditry pages to disk in the correct order.
- Specialized prefetching.
- Buffer replacement plicy.
- Thread/process scheduling.

## For Database Storage

**Problem 1:** How the DBMS represents the database in files on disk.

**Problem 2:** How the DBMS manages its memory and move data back-and-forth from disk.
 
Most DB, espesically new DB in current years store database as one or more files on disk.

Early systems in 1980s use custom filesystems on raw storage.

### About Pages

There are three differeent notions of "pages" in a DBMS:

- Hardware Page (usually 4KB)
- OS Page (usually 4KB)
- Database Page (512B-16KB)
  - 4KB: SQLite DB2 Oracle
  - 8KB: SQL-Server PostgreSQL
  - 16KB: MySQL
